The implication

IB_{rho0} ⇒ CLR(4,4,2; rho0, C0)

with parameters
rho0 = 1
C0 = 1

has been exhaustively verified for all graphs with n ≤ 6
under the assumptions:
- maximum degree ≤ 4
- FO^4 radius-2 homogeneity
- IB_{rho0}

No strict counterexample exists in this range.

Larger n is computationally exponential and left open.
