Counterexamples Directory
This directory contains records and artifacts related to the counterexample search
for the Cycle–Local Rigidity bounded verification.
Verified Domain
Graphs examined satisfy all of the following:
Number of vertices n ≤ 7
Maximum degree Δ ≤ 4
FO⁴ radius-2 homogeneity
Ihara–Bass / nonbacktracking spectral condition with ρ₀ = 1
Result
No counterexample was found within the verified domain.

(future) enumeration logs or intermediate artifacts, if added
Scope
This directory documents a bounded negative result only.
No claims are made beyond the stated bounds.
Reproducibility
All verification artifacts are included in release v0.1.0.
