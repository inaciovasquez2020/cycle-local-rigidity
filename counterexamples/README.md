# Counterexamples Directory

This folder contains artifacts and data related to counterexample search for the cycle-local rigidity verification.

## Contents

- COUNTEREXAMPLES.md — Detailed counterexample record (no counterexamples found within bounded domain)
- (optional) enumeration data (e.g., graphs, log outputs)
- (optional) filter execution traces

No graph in the verified domain (n ≤ 7, Δ ≤ 4, FO⁴ radius-2 homogeneous, IB₁) violates the cycle-local rigidity bound.
