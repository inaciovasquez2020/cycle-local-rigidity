# cycle-local-rigidity

This repository contains the research implementation and analysis for Cycle-Local Rigidity within the Universal Reference Frame (URF) framework. It is an indexed component of the Vasquez research ecosystem.

## Overview
The `cycle-local-rigidity` module provides the computational logic and mathematical modeling for cyclic rigidity constraints and local stability as part of the broader URF research suite.

## Canonical Registry
This repository is a registered module of the Vasquez Index. Stable references, archival DOIs, and reproducibility links are maintained at:
* [Vasquez Index Dashboard](https://inaciovasquez2020.github.io/vasquez-index/dashboard.html)

## Repository Status
* **Repository Handle:** inaciovasquez2020/cycle-local-rigidity
* **Stability:** Refer to the Vasquez Index for the latest stable DOI and version history.
* **Infrastructure:** [scientific-infrastructure](https://github.com/inaciovasquez2020/scientific-infrastructure)

---

## Technical Notes
* **Integration:** This module is designed to interface with `urf-core` and `terminal-rigidity-witness-erb` to maintain theoretical consistency across the ecosystem.
* **Reproducibility:** To ensure consistent computational results, utilize the environment configurations defined in the `scientific-infrastructure` module.
* **Scope:** This repository focuses on the formal verification of cyclic dependencies and local rigidity properties.
