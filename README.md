# Cycle–Local Rigidity for FO^4 on Bounded-Degree Graphs (k=4, Δ=4, r=2)

This repository contains:
- `paper.pdf` — manuscript
- `certificate.json` — finite rigidity certificate
- `certificate.sha256` — SHA-256 digest for verification

## Verify the certificate hash
```bash
sha256sum certificate.json
# should equal the contents of certificate.sha256
