Cycle–Local Rigidity (Bounded Verification)
This manuscript documents a bounded exhaustive verification for graphs with n ≤ 7, Δ ≤ 4,
FO^4 radius-2 homogeneity, and an Ihara–Bass spectral condition.
No unbounded or asymptotic claims are made.
All results are certified by deterministic artifacts included in the v0.1.0 release.
