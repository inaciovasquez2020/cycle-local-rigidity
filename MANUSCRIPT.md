Cycle–Local Rigidity: Bounded Exhaustive Verification
We present a bounded exhaustive verification for graphs with n ≤ 7, maximum degree Δ ≤ 4,
FO^4 radius-2 homogeneity, and an Ihara–Bass spectral condition.
Result:
No counterexample exists to the stated cycle–local rigidity implication within the verified bounds.
Scope:
This manuscript makes no unbounded or asymptotic claims.
